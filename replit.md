# GeoPulse - AI Visibility Analyzer

## Overview

GeoPulse is a production-ready SaaS application that analyzes a brand's visibility across AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity). The system scrapes websites, uses OpenAI's GPT models to discover competitors and generate insights, then presents detailed analytics through a modern dashboard interface.

**Core Value Proposition**: Provide businesses with actionable insights about how AI platforms perceive and recommend their brand compared to competitors.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite as the build tool

**UI Component System**:
- **shadcn/ui** component library (Radix UI primitives with custom styling)
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **Design System**: Minimalist black and white aesthetic with strategic blue accent
- **Color Palette**: Black (#000000) primary, white (#FFFFFF) background, gray (#6B7280) text, blue (#3B82F6) accent
- **Path Aliases**: Configured for clean imports (`@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/hooks`, `@shared`)

**Landing Page Design** (November 2025 Redesign - GEOoptimize Style):
- **Navigation**: Black circular logo icon, plain gray nav links (Features, Pricing, Resources, About), black "Start Free Trial" button
- **Hero Section**: 
  - Headline: "Be Found in the Age of AI." with black liquid glass highlight on "Age of AI" (white text on glossy black pill background)
  - Sub-headline: "Advanced GEO targeting and optimization tools that boost your visibility in specific geographic markets"
  - No badge, no metrics section
- **Search Component**: White rounded-full input with "www.techstartup.io" placeholder, circular black search icon button positioned inside on the right
- **Visual Style**: Clean, minimalist, professional with high contrast and generous whitespace

**State Management**:
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management and API caching
- Local React state for UI interactions
- Custom query client with configured defaults (no automatic refetching, infinite stale time)

**Routing**: 
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- Single-page application with `/` (Home) and 404 routes

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Rationale**: shadcn/ui chosen for type-safe, accessible components that can be customized and owned by the codebase
- **Alternative**: Material-UI or Chakra UI were considered but shadcn offers better control
- **Pros**: Full component ownership, excellent TypeScript support, accessibility built-in
- **Cons**: Requires more initial setup compared to batteries-included libraries

### Backend Architecture

**Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js

**API Design**:
- RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix
- Single primary endpoint: `POST /api/analyze` - accepts URL, returns complete analysis
- Middleware for JSON parsing, request logging, and response tracking

**Service Layer Architecture**:
```
routes.ts → analyzer.ts → {
  scraper.ts (cheerio-based web scraping)
  openai.ts (GPT API wrapper)
}
```

**Storage Strategy**:
- In-memory storage implementation (MemStorage class)
- Interface-based design (IStorage) allows easy swap to database
- Caching layer: Analysis results cached by URL to avoid redundant OpenAI API calls

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Problem**: Expensive AI API calls and slow analysis times
- **Solution**: In-memory caching of analysis results by URL
- **Rationale**: Most URLs won't change frequently; cache invalidation can be added later
- **Pros**: Instant responses for repeated analyses, reduced API costs
- **Cons**: Cache lost on server restart, no persistence across deployments

### AI Integration Architecture

**Primary AI Service**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via official SDK

**AI Workflow**:
1. **Website Scraping**: Cheerio extracts content, metadata, and page structure
2. **Brand Extraction**: GPT analyzes scraped content to identify brand name, industry, description
3. **Competitor Discovery**: GPT-powered analysis to find real competitors (not hardcoded)
4. **Platform Visibility Analysis**: GPT simulates how each AI platform would rank/mention the brand
5. **Dimension Scoring**: GPT evaluates across 6 dimensions (mention rate, context quality, sentiment, etc.)
6. **Recommendations Generation**: GPT provides actionable improvement suggestions

**OpenAI Integration Pattern**:
```typescript
chat(messages: ChatMessage[], options) → Promise<string>
analyzeWithGPT(prompt, { systemPrompt?, jsonMode?, temperature? })
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Problem**: Need structured data from AI responses
- **Solution**: JSON mode for GPT responses with Zod schema validation
- **Rationale**: Ensures type safety and predictable data structures
- **Pros**: Type-safe responses, automatic validation, clear contracts
- **Cons**: Requires careful prompt engineering for consistent JSON output

### Data Schemas

**Primary Data Model** (`AnalysisResult`):
```typescript
{
  url: string
  brandInfo: { name, domain, industry?, description? }
  overallScore: number (0-100)
  platformScores: Array<{ platform, score, color }>
  dimensionScores: Array<{ dimension, score, fullMark }>
  competitors: Array<{ rank, name, domain, score, marketOverlap, strengths, isCurrentBrand? }>
  gaps: Array<{ element, impact, found }>
  recommendations: Array<{ title, description, priority, category, actionItems, estimatedImpact }>
}
```

**Schema Validation**: Zod schemas in `shared/schema.ts` for runtime type checking

### Development Tooling

**Build System**:
- **Vite** for frontend with React plugin
- **esbuild** for backend bundling
- **TypeScript** strict mode enabled across entire codebase

**Dev Experience**:
- Replit-specific plugins: runtime error overlay, cartographer, dev banner
- Hot module replacement for instant feedback
- Shared types between frontend/backend via `shared/` directory

**Database Preparation** (not yet implemented):
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` (users table ready)
- Migration tooling set up via drizzle-kit
- Connection via Neon serverless driver

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Problem**: Type safety between frontend and backend
- **Solution**: Shared schema directory with Zod schemas
- **Rationale**: Single source of truth for data structures
- **Pros**: Full type safety, runtime validation, no drift between client/server
- **Cons**: Requires careful organization to avoid circular dependencies

## External Dependencies
