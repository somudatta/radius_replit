📊 Score Calculation Formulas
Overall GEO Score
Final Score = (AIC × 0.40) + (CES × 0.35) + (MTS × 0.25)
Factor Scores (AIC, CES, MTS)
Factor Score = (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5) / 5
Competitor Comparison
Discovery = (Your_Mentions / Total_Mentions) × 10
Comparison = (Wins / Total_Comparisons) × 10
Utility = Average(Solution_Depth, Clarity, Coverage)

🔍 What Each Metric Measures
AIC (40% weight) - Answerability & Intent Coverage

s1: Intent Coverage - Do you answer all user questions?
s2: Directness - How quickly do you get to the answer?
s3: Completeness - Is your content comprehensive?
s4: Consistency - Is info up-to-date and consistent?
s5: Conversational - Is it AI-conversation ready?

CES (35% weight) - Credibility, Evidence & Safety

s1: Evidence Density - Citations, stats, facts
s2: Author Transparency - Who wrote this?
s3: Experience & Originality - First-hand expertise?
s4: Safety & Disclaimers - Appropriate warnings?
s5: Freshness - Is content current?

MTS (25% weight) - Machine-Readability & Technical

s1: Structure & Semantics - HTML quality
s2: Schema & Metadata - Structured data markup
s3: Entity Clarity - Clear definitions
s4: Crawlability - Can AI access content?
s5: Reusability - Easy to extract?


🏆 Competitor Discovery Process

Keyword Extraction → Extract 50-100 industry keywords
AI Response Mining → Query 6 platforms, track mentions
Semantic Similarity → Find similar websites via embeddings
Citation Analysis → Track co-cited brands
Manual Verification → Filter false positives


❓ The 7 Critical Consumer Questions
Discovery (30%)

"What are the top [category] companies?"
"Who makes [product type]?"

Comparison (35%)

"[Brand A] vs [Brand B] - which is better?"
"Compare [Product A] and [Product B]"
"[Brand] alternatives?"

Utility (35%)

"How to solve [problem] using [Product]?"
"[Product] best practices"

💡 Pro Tips

Start with mock data - Don't wait for real API integration
Use the constants file - Everything is pre-defined
Black & white only - Stick to the minimalist theme
Info buttons everywhere - Make every metric clickable
Performance matters - Cache, lazy load, optimize
Mobile-first - Design for small screens
Accessibility - Proper ARIA labels, keyboard nav


🐛 Common Issues & Solutions
Issue: PDF not generating
Solution: Make sure @react-pdf/renderer is installed correctly
bashnpm install @react-pdf/renderer --save
Issue: Info buttons not showing tooltips
Solution: Check z-index and positioning
css.info-tooltip {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 9999;
}
Issue: Scores not calculating correctly
Solution: Use the helper functions from types.ts
typescriptimport { calculateWeightedScore, calculateFactorScore } from './types';
Issue: "Open in ChatGPT" not working
Solution: Ensure proper URL encoding
typescriptconst url = `https://chat.openai.com/?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;

📚 Key Libraries to Install
bashnpm install @react-pdf/renderer
npm install jspdf html2canvas
npm install lucide-react
npm install recharts
npm install react-tooltip
